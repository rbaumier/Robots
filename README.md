# Game

As a first java project ever, I did a robots game. There is 2 kinds of robots : polluters and cleaners.
Polluters have to pollute cell and cleaners have to ... clean it.

I adapted this game by replacing robots by marvel superheros :)<br><br>

### Block free

Robots move in such a way that they can block each others. You can try for example with 1ms as refresh time, they will never block.

### TroubleShouting :

Error: Could not find or load main class org.robots.models.World
  -> CLASSPATH=/path/to/project/Robots/src; export CLASSPATH;
